# Mini-Project Summary: DCGAN on CIFAR10 Dataset

## Objective:
The objective of this mini-project is to apply a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on the CIFAR10 dataset. The project aims to train a generator following a specified architecture and a discriminator with a minimum of 3 convolutional layers. Additionally, after completing the training process, the project will generate 32 images and evaluate if there are any issues of mode collapse.

## Details:

### DCGAN Architecture
- **Generator:** Implement a generator with a specified architecture, with the final convolutional layer adjusted to match the dimensions of the input real images from the CIFAR10 dataset.
- **Discriminator:** Develop a discriminator with a minimum of 3 convolutional layers to discriminate between real and generated images effectively.
- **Number of Epochs:** Train the DCGAN model for a minimum of 300 epochs to ensure robust learning and generation of high-quality images.
- **Mode Collapse Analysis:** After training, generate 32 images using the trained DCGAN model and evaluate if there are any signs of mode collapse, where the generator fails to produce diverse images.

## Conclusion:
This mini-project focuses on applying a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) architecture on the CIFAR10 dataset. It emphasizes training a generator and discriminator with specified architectures, generating images, and analyzing potential issues such as mode collapse in the generated images.
